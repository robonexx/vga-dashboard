- [x] Add modal

- Added api to search bar to connect with rawg.io

- [] Add local storage
- [] Add a modal to show search results
- [] Add function to save a game to local storage

could be a db connection to something like firebase, log in, have profile image and saved games there. In real project it would ofcourse be connected to something like xbox, ps or steam, battle.net databases
