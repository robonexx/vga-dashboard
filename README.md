# VGA DASHBOARD

## React + TypeScript + Vite + Styled-components + framer-motion

### Desciption

With this project i try to create a gaming dashboard and incorporate an api to be able to searh games 

I found a design in figma i liked and want to try to create it, challenge:
 not the way we are used to do it, check the sizes and such from the desing directly but try to see how close I can come with just trying to style it as i go. (strange i know) but its a  nice challenge. Also let me have some room to make changes if i feel like doing some changes to it. Still design is the goal. I will how ever use the assets, and icons. :D

Lets see how close i can come
You can find the desing here:
